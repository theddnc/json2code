# json2code

## About
json2code is a small project implemented entirely by me in order to pass Compilation Techniques class on FEIT WUT. 
The class focuses on mechanism such as parsers or scanners (lexers) and on other compilation related tasks. json2code's
main functionality is to:

1. Sample few RESTful API endpoints for some data examples
2. Parse json responses
3. ???
4. Profit: generate Apple's Swift's code for data model classes

This page will be updated as soon as the '???' will be though through.
